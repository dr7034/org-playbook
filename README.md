# Operator Validation System – Template Repository

This is a structured validation framework for technical operators, startup builders, or fractional CTOs who want to turn raw insight into executable growth systems.

> ⚠️ This is a **template repo**, not a live system. Clone or fork this to run with real data.

## 🔧 Purpose

This system enables you to:

- Validate or kill product ideas rapidly
- Score and filter customer personas with confidence
- Run high-signal growth loops
- Document execution and team playbooks
- Define off-ramp conditions for founder/operator exit
