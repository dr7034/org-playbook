# checkpoints/README.md

## âœ… Checkpoints Overview â€“ Operator Validation System

This folder holds mandatory stage completion checklists. Every phase of the validation system has a gate. No stage can proceed without a corresponding checkpoint file that proves it has been passed.

---

### â›³ Required Checkpoint Files

Each of the following must be filled out and committed before advancing:

- `interviews.md` â€“ 3+ interviews, 1 scored â‰¥7
- `persona.md` â€“ 1+ persona scored â‰¥14
- `wedge.md` â€“ 1 wedge loop run with score â‰¥15
- `monetization.md` â€“ payment, strong quote, or validated price point
- `systems.md` â€“ growth + delivery documented and delegated

---

### ðŸ§¾ Checkpoint File Format

Each file follows this structure:

```markdown
# Checkpoint: [Stage Name]

- **Date completed:** [YYYY-MM-DD]
- **Summary of evidence:** [Brief bulletproof notes on signal]
- **Score:** [Numerical score if applicable]
- **Link to supporting docs:** [URL or relative repo path]
```

---

### ðŸ”’ Enforced Use

No code, mocks, or specs may proceed unless checkpoint files are:

- Present
- Scored
- Referenced in the corresponding `/growth-loops/` or `/playbooks/` doc

Example in a test loop file:

```markdown
âœ… Checkpoint Met: `../checkpoints/persona.md` â†’ SCORE: 15
```

---

### ðŸ“‚ Suggested Files

You may also include optional check-ins for:

- `re-interviews.md` â€“ periodic rescoring of key personas
- `delegation.md` â€“ delegation tracker snapshot
- `loop-history.md` â€“ cross-loop pattern trends

These are not enforced, but useful for decision audits and operator handoffs.

Keep this folder tightly managed. It represents the heartbeat of your validation integrity.
