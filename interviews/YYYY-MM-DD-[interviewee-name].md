## Calculation

- Total Weighted Score = Sum of (Score × Weight) + Interview Type Adjustment  
- Max possible raw weighted score (no penalty) = 5 × Sum of weights = 5 × 38 = 190  
- Scoring thresholds (example):  
  - ≥130: Strong fit, prioritize  
  - 90–129: Moderate fit, investigate  
  - <90: Low fit or needs more probing

## Usage Notes

- Score each question 1–5 reflecting signal strength (1 = no signal, 5 = strong).  
- Multiply by weight for weighted contribution.  
- Apply -5 penalty if interviewee was paid to discount bias, but do not disqualify automatically.  
- Use this to gate personas and loops as a required checkpoint.
