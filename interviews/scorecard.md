| Specificity       | Were examples concrete, or was it abstract talk?               |
| Urgency           | Did the user indicate this is a “now” problem?                 |
| Problem Ownership | Is the user the one who _feels_ and _solves_ the problem?      |
| Economic Value    | Is the pain tied to time, money, or operations?                |
