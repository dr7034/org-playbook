| Interviewee unpaid? | 0         | No adjustment                                            |

## 🔢 Calculation

- Total Weighted Score = Sum of (Score × Weight) + Interview Type Adjustment
- Max possible raw weighted score (no penalty) = 5 × Sum of weights = 5 × 38 = 190
- Scoring thresholds (example):
  - ≥130: Strong fit, prioritize
  - 90–129: Moderate fit, investigate
  - <90: Low fit or needs more probing

## Usage Notes

- Score each question 1–5 reflecting strength of signal (1 = no signal, 5 = strong).
- Multiply by weight for weighted contribution.
- Apply -5 penalty if interviewee was paid to discount bias but do not disqualify automatically.
- Use this for gating personas and loops as a required checkpoint.
