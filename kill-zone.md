# Kill Zone

This file defines the time limits for loops, personas, or ideas to either prove themselves—or get archived.

## Purpose

To prevent slow bleed from unvalidated or stagnant work. Ideas must earn continued investment through real signal.

## Rules

- Every new loop or initiative gets a kill date (typically 7–10 days from launch).
- On review:
  - If no signal → kill
  - If weak signal → pivot once
  - If validated → continue & codify

## Tags

Use `#killed`, `#extended`, `#pivoted`, `#validated` for loop file metadata
