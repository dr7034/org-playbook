## 🌟 Strategic Outcomes – Operator Validation System

This file tracks whether the system is producing true market pull and execution readiness. If any of these outcomes are not met, do **not** proceed to product build or scale.

---

### ✅ 1. Validated Persona with Monetization Signal

- [ ] A target persona scored ≥14
- [ ] They expressed willingness to pay or asked for pricing
- [ ] At least one quote request or verbal pricing agreement received

🧪 Linked Evidence:

- `/personas/ops-director.md`
- `/interviews/2025-06-15-outreach-specialist.md`

---

### ✅ 2. Repeatable Wedge Loop Showing Pull

- [ ] Loop scored ≥15 on at least two separate runs
- [ ] Conversion was user-initiated or opt-in, not pushed
- [ ] Feedback suggests usefulness, not novelty

🧪 Linked Evidence:

- `/growth-loops/wedge-crm-cleaner-1.md`
- `/patterns.md`

---

### ✅ 3. Confirmed Revenue Signal

- [ ] User paid, or committed to pay, or requested formal pricing
- [ ] No discounts were used to create urgency
- [ ] Pricing hypothesis validated with >1 user

🧪 Linked Evidence:

- `/revenue-sightings.md`

---

### ✅ 4. Operator System Readiness

- [ ] Delegation tracker shows ≥80% coverage
- [ ] ≥50% of core functions marked as “Owned”
- [ ] No weekly update or async loop requires operator push

🧪 Linked Evidence:

- `/delegation.md`
- `/off-ramp/`

---

### ✅ 5. Durable Delivery and Growth Rhythm

- [ ] Tech + product cadence exists (weekly cycle, monthly retro)
- [ ] Escalation paths are documented and team-owned
- [ ] Growth and delivery playbooks are codified

🧪 Linked Evidence:

- `/playbooks/execution-rhythm.md`
- `/playbooks/systems-of-insight.md`

## 🧠 System Notes

This system exists to produce one of the following outcomes:

### 1. Build With Signal

You identify at least one validated persona, one repeatable wedge loop, and clear monetization signal. You ship a product or feature **only once**:

- Persona score ≥14
- Loop score ≥15, repeated
- Pricing accepted or paid

### 2. Pivot With Evidence

You uncover critical objections or loop failures early, and **deliberately shift direction** based on:

- 3x wedge runs scoring <12
- Consistent negative persona feedback
- No monetization path within 30 days

### 3. Exit the Build Phase

As a fractional CTO, you can hand off ownership **once systems operate weekly without you**:

- Delegation tracker ≥80% coverage
- Growth + delivery playbooks running
- Revenue model proven, quoting repeatable

---

Each outcome is supported by checkpoints and scorecards.

This repo is not for building prototypes. It is for validating, learning, and handing off when signal is real
