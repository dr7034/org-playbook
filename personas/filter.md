This file defines how personas are scored, tiered, and qualified for go-to-market motion. Every interview passes through this model before advancing to wedge tests or growth loops.

## ðŸŽ¯ Persona Scoring Criteria

Score each criterion from 0â€“2:

| Criteria               | 0 = No Signal          | 1 = Partial Signal        | 2 = High Signal                                |
| ---------------------- | ---------------------- | ------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| **Pain Clarity**       | Vague / abstract       | Recognized but not urgent | Urgent, clear, and quantified                  |
| **Buyer Authority**    | No budget control      | Influencer only           | Final decision-maker / owns budget             |
| **Repeatability**      | Edge case / one-off    | Mid-tier use case         | Frequent, broad, or recurring across verticals |
| **Current Workaround** | None or unclear        | Partial workaround        | Painful, manual, or expensive workaround       |
| **Willingness to Act** | Passive, no next steps | Interested but slow       | Proactive, wants a solution now                |

**Total score: X/10**

### ðŸ§  System Notes

This scoring model must be applied before any tests or outreach sequences.

If a persona is not a Tier 1 or Tier 2, it cannot enter /growth-loops/.

This file is audited regularly to reduce false positives and founder bias.
