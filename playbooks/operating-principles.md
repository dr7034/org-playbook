These principles define how the system thinks, acts, and avoids waste. They are defaults for decision-making and a cultural anchor for new contributors.

ðŸ§  Operating Principles

"We never build until signal"

"We donâ€™t trust what users sayâ€”only what they do"

"We prioritize high-leverage loops, not ideas"

"We document what works before we delegate it"

"We donâ€™t optimize for comfortâ€”only clarity and compounding"

"We exit when the system operates without usâ€”not before"

Each principle is enforced as a default in system guardrails, scoring models, and persona validation processes. This is how the Operator Validation System avoids waste, protects momentum, and maintains high signal-to-execution integrity.

### ðŸ“Ž Linked to System Guardrails

These principles inform go/no-go decisions in:

- `system-guardrails.md`: enforcing loop and persona standards
- `outcomes.md`: checking build readiness
- `kill-zone.md`: codifying critical objections
