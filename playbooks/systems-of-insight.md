# System of Insight

How we turn feedback and raw signal into product, operations, and growth decisions.

---

## Inputs

- Interviews (`/interviews/`)
- Growth loop outcomes (`/growth-loops/`)
- Suggestion frequency (`/suggestions/inbox.md`)
- Patterns (`/patterns.md`)
- Revenue signals (`/revenue-sightings.md`)

---

## Feedback Cadence

- Weekly: tag new patterns, update loops
- Monthly: update playbooks if patterns repeat 3x
- Quarterly: archive outdated signals, re-score personas

---

## Insight Conversion Rules

1. Repeated quote or theme across 2+ sources → move to pattern
2. Validated pattern → new test in `/growth-loops/`
3. Objections → update `/execution-rhythm.md` or docs
4. Revenue signal → flag in `/revenue-sightings.md` and link to active loop

## Team Roles

| Role     | Responsibility                       |
| -------- | ------------------------------------ |
| Operator | Owns loop decisions and scoring      |
| Builder  | Ships based on signal or feedback    |
| Analyst  | Maintains patterns + signal tracking |
