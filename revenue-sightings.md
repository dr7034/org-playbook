# Revenue Sightings

This log tracks any mention, signal, or data related to budget, pricing, willingness to pay, or commercial appetite.

## Example Format

| Date       | Source       | Summary                                               | Value Estimate | Persona        | Action           |
| ---------- | ------------ | ----------------------------------------------------- | -------------- | -------------- | ---------------- |
| 2025-06-18 | Interview #1 | “We’d pay £500/year if this replaces our spreadsheet” | £500           | Field Ops Lead | Build test       |
| 2025-06-18 | Loop 001     | 2 users asked for pricing info                        | —              | SMB Owner      | Add pricing page |

## Rules

- “I would pay…” = signal
- “We already budget for…” = signal
- Actual pre-sales = log in bold + linked to loop

Use this to trigger pricing experiments or MVP builds
