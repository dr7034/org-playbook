# Wedge Strategy

This folder contains your **go-to-market entry strategy**—the smallest, sharpest problem you can solve that creates a natural pull into the rest of your solution.

The wedge must:

- Be painful and urgent for a very specific persona
- Be easy to test via outbound loops
- Deliver immediate value on first use
- Create a natural path to expansion once adopted

## Wedge Best Practices

- Use language from interviews (`/interviews/`)
- Target scored personas (≥14 in `/personas/`)
- Track performance via `/growth-loops/`
- Update if wedge doesn’t convert → new test
- Confirm pull-through features before building them

---

## If the Wedge Works...

You’ve found:

- A repeatable value delivery point
- A predictable source of user engagement
- A scalable route to product expansion

Then you build. Until then, test harder.
