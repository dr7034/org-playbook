# Growth Wedge Strategy

This file defines our narrowest point of market entry, the wedge we use to unlock adoption, engagement, and expansion. It must be simple, urgent, and immediately valuable to a very specific persona.

## 1. Wedge Hypothesis

- **Problem to Solve:**  
  What burning problem will get immediate attention?

- **Persona Who Cares Most:**  
  [Name + title + environment]

- **Channel They Live In:**  
  [Slack group / LinkedIn title / subreddit / forum]

- **Why Now:**  
  [What trigger makes them act now vs later?]

## 2. Wedge Product Slice

| Feature / CTA                    | Outcome / Value Delivered              | Build State |
| -------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- | ----------- |
| ****\*\*****\_\_\_\_****\*\***** | ******\*\*******\_\_\_******\*\******* | [ ] Todo    |
| ****\*\*****\_\_\_\_****\*\***** | ******\*\*******\_\_\_******\*\******* | [ ] Todo    |

Example:

| Feature / CTA            | Outcome / Value Delivered     | Build State |
| ------------------------ | ----------------------------- | ----------- |
| Automated shift fill     | Avoids 8 calls per shift      | [x] Built   |
| Schedule snapshot export | Used in client billing emails | [ ] In dev  |

## 3. Pull-Through Potential

Once the wedge delivers value, what else becomes inevitable?

- [ ] Adoption of related workflows
- [ ] Aggregation of more users internally
- [ ] Increased reliance (daily/weekly)
- [ ] Reporting / analytics expansion

---

## 4. Wedge Risks

- Too small to matter
- Not painful enough
- Easy to build, hard to monetize
- No clear upsell path

---

## 5. Metrics of Success

- 3+ interviews confirm wedge priority
- 1+ growth loop shows traction (CTR or response > 20%)
- Pattern repeats across 2+ segments or personas

---

## 6. Actions

- [ ] Test wedge hypothesis in interviews
- [ ] Score urgency (persona â‰¥ 14)
- [ ] Run wedge-focused growth loop
- [ ] Measure value delivery / adoption signal
- [ ] Update `/patterns.md` and `/kill-zone.md` as needed
